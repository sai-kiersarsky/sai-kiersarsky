I am a research scientist doing work in machine learning and neursocience.

My interests center around interdisciplinary cognitive science - especially neuroscience, AI, consciousness, language, and the philosophy that surrounds those topics.
I may consider a PhD in future years. Currently I am finishing a Master's Degree in Comptuer Science with a machine learning focus which will be complete June 2023, and am actively seeking employment.  

Some of my academic inspirations are Joscha Bach, Douglas Hofstadter, Selen Atasoy, and Leonid Perlovsky.

I also like travel, dancing, and music.
