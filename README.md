I am a research scientist doing work in machine learning and computational neursocience. Currently I am finishing a Master's Degree in Comptuer Science with a machine learning focus which will be complete June 2023, and am actively seeking employment.  

My machine learning interests are neural representation, data clustering, and data analysis. I am equally invested in machine learning theory and practice.

In computational neuroscience I am participating in an international collaboration doing original research on how changes in the structure of the brain affect during the aging process affects neural dynamics. We are using and developing a novel methodology known as Connectome Harmonics.

Some of my academic inspirations are Joscha Bach, Douglas Hofstadter, Selen Atasoy, and Leonid Perlovsky.

I also like travel, dancing, and music.
